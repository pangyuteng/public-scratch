"""In early 2016, we launched Wednesday-expiring SPX Weeklys. This expiration profile aligned with the expiration of VIX® Weeklys futures and options. Monday Weeklys followed that year to address weekend risk. By 2022, Cboe had listed an SPX Weeklys option with an expiration for each day of the week (Monday through Friday). Those launches added scores of expiration cycles to SPX options (over the course of a year), which resulted in more opportunities for same day trading. What was once a more limited opportunity set is now vast, opening the door for market participants to trade and hedge with the precision of a hand surgeon. In 2023, SPX 0DTE options trading has represented roughly 43% of average daily volume (ADV)."""
